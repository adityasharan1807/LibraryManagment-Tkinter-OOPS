### 1.GUI Components:

Main Window: The primary Tkinter window that hosts the entire application.
Book Section: Widgets for adding and viewing books.
Member Section: Widgets for adding and viewing members.
Transaction Section: Widgets for issuing, returning books, calculating fines, and viewing transactions.

### 2.Event Handlers:

These are functions like add_book, add_member, issue_book, return_book, view_books, view_members, and view_transactions that are triggered by user actions (e.g., button clicks).

### 3.Database Interaction:

The application interacts with the SQLite database (library.db) to store and retrieve information about books, members, and transactions.
SQL queries are executed to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on the database tables (books, members, transactions).

### Workflow:
##### 1.User Interaction:

The user interacts with the GUI components (e.g., adding a book, viewing members).

#### 2.Event Handling:
Each interaction triggers an event handler function in the code.

#### 3.Database Operations:
The event handlers perform CRUD operations on the SQLite database.
For example, add_book inserts a new book into the books table, and view_books retrieves all books from the books table.

#### 4.Display Results:
The application displays results back to the user through the GUI, such as showing a list of books or members.
